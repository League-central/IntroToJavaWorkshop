            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>

                <li>Open GooglyEyes.pde using Processing.</li>

                <li>Choose a face image from the "img" folder in _2_googly_eyes, then drag and drop it into your
                    processing window
                </li>

                <li>On line 1 of your sketch (outside of the methods) declare a variable for the image:
                    <div style="width:100%;">
                    <pre>PImage face;
</pre>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>In your setup() method, import your image using the following code:
                    <div style="width:100%;">
                    <pre>
face = loadImage(“face.jpg”);
</pre>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>Change the code you just entered so that “face.jpg” matches the name of the picture you chose.
                </li>

                <li>Set the size of your sketch and the size of your image to be the same by entering the following code
                    in the setup method.
                    <div style="width:100%;">
                    <pre>size(800,600);
face.resize(width,height);
</pre>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>In the draw() method, place a white ellipse over the left eye of your image.<br> HINT: To find out
                    where to put it, add code to print the mouseX and mouseY where you click the mouse.
                    <div style="width:100%;">
                    <pre>if(mousePressed){
    println("Mouse’s x-position: " + mouseX + "\n" +
     "Mouse’s y-position: " + mouseY + "\n");
}   </pre>
                    </div>
                </li>

                <li>Now add a smaller black ellipse to the left eye to represent the pupil</li>

                <li>Add a white ellipse over the right eye using the same technique used for the left eye.</li>

                <li>Use mouseX and mouseY to make left pupil follow the mouse.</li>

                <li>In your head, find the difference (using subtraction) between the left eye's x-position and right eye's x-position, and
                    remember the value.
                </li>

                <li>In your head, find the difference (using subtraction) between the left eye's y-position and right eye's y-position, and
                    remember the value.
                </li>

                <li>Draw a second black ellipse for the right pupil, making its position relative to the left pupil. Do
                    this by setting the x and y values for the ellipse using mouseX + [x-position difference] and mouseY
                    + [y-position difference].
                </li>

                <li>Here’s the tricky part: we now need to stop the pupils from traveling outside of the eyes. Luckily,
                    since we are drawing the right pupil relative to the left pupil, we will only need to do the
                    following
                    steps for one eye. Use the image below as a reference for the following steps:
                </li>
                <img src="./img/googlyEyesExplanation.jpg" alt="googly eyes explanation"
                     style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%; margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 3em;">
                <li>
                    First, imagine a rectangle inside the left eye, within which you want the pupil to stay.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Taking advantage of the code that we added above to print out the location where the user clicks
                    their
                    mouse, click on the corners of your imaginary square and record the values. Notice that the values
                    in
                    the example image are nice and round, but yours will probably be less friendly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write an if-statement <strong>before you draw your pupil</strong> that will keep the pupil from
                    moving past the left edge of the eye, as the example
                    image demonstrates. To do this, you will first find the smallest value for x that exists within your
                    imaginary
                    square. You will check if the mouse's x value is smaller than that, and if it is, set it back to the
                    smallest
                    value within your imaginary square.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add three more if-statements, one for each of the remaining directions that the pupil could leave
                    the eye:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If mouseX is greater than the largest x-value within your imaginary square, then reset
                            mouseX to the largest x-value within your square
                        </li>
                        <li>If mouseY is less than the smallest y-value within your imaginary square, then reset mouseY
                            to the smallest y-value within your square
                        </li>
                        <li>Ff mouseY is greater than the largest y-value within your imaginary square, then reset
                            mouseY to the largest y-value within your square
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Make sure you SAVE YOUR CODE when you are done.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Extra: Make the color of the eyes change when the user moves the mouse, by using the mouseX and mouseY
                    variables in the fill() for the eyes.
                </li>
            </ol>
